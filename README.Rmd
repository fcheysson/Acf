# Acf

This package provides a wrapper for R functions `acf` and `pacf` for simultaneous plotting of acf and pacf.

## Installation

You can install the released version of Acf from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("Acf")
```

## Example

Let's test `Acf` on an AR(2) series which plots its acf and pacf.

```{r example}
library(Acf)
e <- rnorm(1000)
x <- filter(e, c(.5, .3), method="recursive")
Acf(x)
```
